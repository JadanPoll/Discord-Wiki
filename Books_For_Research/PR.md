### Project Description:
We're working on code to turn Discord into a powerful search engine for games, RSO information, and much more. Simply type in a topic, and our engine instantly generates a live, dynamic website based on the conversations happening in your Discord servers and channels. No more endless searching – get instant, relevant results from the places where you and your community are already talking.

## Insights:
Every great search engine boasts a host of cool unique features, and so do we! We call these **Insights**—special tools that add fun functionality to elevate your search experience.
