Every semester, we try our best to match everyone to a project and provide opportunities to gain experience. However, given the large volume of interested students, we are sadly unable to guarantee everyone a project spot. If we were unable to match you to a project this semester, please know that our decision was not a reflection of your abilities or potential. Project: Code will continue to offer new projects next semester as well as other events throughout the semester - we would love to see you there!

The Project: Code Team
doteng: We've had some people reach out to ask about how the waitlist works so here are some clarifications: 

❓ **When does the waitlist come in?**
When someone matched to a project declines or doesn't accept their offer by the given deadline (EOD this Thursday)

❓ **Are spots offered to people on the waitlist in the same order as the sheet?**
No. We will reconsider project matching form responses and discuss with PMs, then send the offer to the person who would be the best fit for the team

❓ **I'm on the waitlist, when can I expect to hear back?**
By next Thursday. Each person on the waitlist who is offered a spot will have 1 day to respond before we send the offer to the next person.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
