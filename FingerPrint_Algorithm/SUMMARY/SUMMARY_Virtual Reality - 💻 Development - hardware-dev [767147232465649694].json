One user proposes modifying old Xbox controllers to provide haptic feedback via a 3D-printed mount (DMessage 1097), using a clever workaround to turn the controller rumble into an affordable haptic solution (DMessage 1100). Despite this, others caution that using audio as a proxy for haptics could lead to unwanted feedback at inconvenient times (DMessage 1101).\n</p>\n<h4>\n DIY VR Glove Development\n</h4>\n<p>\n A notable trend is the development of DIY VR gloves. One user is attempting to create a hand tracking glove compatible with SteamVR, aiming to avoid a cumbersome design that requires additional controllers strapped to the wrist (DMessage 1069). The development approach includes focusing on software refinement, starting with cheap and available components, before moving to more professional designs later (DMessage 1076). For finger tracking, the use of Hall Effect sensors and IMUs for each finger segment is considered, though the challenge of drift and the complexity of managing multiple IMUs is acknowledged (DMessage 1063, 1061). There's also a significant focus on the practicality of these gloves in real applications, ensuring they are lightweight and non-fiddly for regular use (DMessage 1064).\n</p>\n<h4>\n Final Thoughts on Prototyping\n</h4>\n<p>\n In the prototyping phase, users emphasize the importance of starting with basic, affordable components and iterating on the design. One user shares their experience of creating a rough prototype by using whatever materials were available, focusing more on testing the software before refining the hardware (DMessage 1078). A mix of sensor experimentation, such as using 360 pots for testing, and ongoing improvements in hardware design is emphasized as essential to refining the glove and making it a viable product in the long run (DMessage 1082, 1078).\n</p>\n<p>\n Overall, the conversation highlights the DIY approach to creating specialized controllers and gloves, with an emphasis on practical solutions, sensor fusion, and affordable haptic feedback mechanisms.\n</p>\n",
    "controller_9": "<p>\n <strong>\n  Topic: Controller Development and Haptics\n </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n The user is focused on building a personal VR controller system and experimenting with various technologies to create functional prototypes, including IMUs, sensors, and haptic feedback systems.\n</p>\n<h3>\n Controller Design and IMU Usage\n</h3>\n<p>\n A significant portion of the discussion revolves around the use of IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units) in VR controllers. There are efforts to incorporate sensors like gyroscopes and accelerometers into glove prototypes, allowing for motion tracking and accurate controller orientation. Some participants recommend using a 9DoF (Degrees of Freedom) IMU, which combines a gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer to improve accuracy in motion tracking (DMessage 1025). Others are working with a 6DoF MPU-6050 for initial prototypes, which includes accelerometers and gyroscopes but lacks a magnetometer (DMessage 1029). There is ongoing experimentation with sensor fusion algorithms to improve the quality of motion tracking (DMessage 1025).\n</p>\n<h3>\n Glove Development\n</h3>\n<p>\n The idea of building a VR glove capable of tracking individual finger movements is also explored. Some participants are looking to develop compact and lightweight versions of gloves, using materials and components like potentiometers for tracking finger flex (DMessage 1044). However, challenges arise in the development of the prototype, such as issues with calibration, incorrect contact in sensors, and the complexity of using multiple IMUs on each finger segment (DMessage 1061, DMessage 1063). One user mentions using Hall effect sensors for finger segment calibration, but expresses concerns about the complexity of managing multiple IMUs on a single glove (DMessage 1063).\n</p>\n<h3>\n Haptics and Feedback Systems\n</h3>\n<p>\n Haptic feedback plays a major role in enhancing the user experience with VR controllers. One of the users is investigating methods to implement haptic feedback cheaply, such as repurposing old Xbox controllers with custom mounts and software (DMessage 1097, DMessage 1100). However, there are challenges with the implementation, particularly regarding how to synchronize the feedback with gameplay. For example, responding to audio signals might trigger haptics at inconvenient times unless specific frequency ranges are filtered to match the desired feedback triggers (DMessage 1101).\n</p>\n<p>\n Furthermore, some users suggest using external devices like HTC tracking pucks, which include pogo pins that can output haptic signals, as a more reliable method for haptic feedback (DMessage 1098). Others mention that although implementing haptic feedback in this manner is cheaper, it might not provide high-end fidelity compared to professional solutions (DMessage 1096).\n</p>\n<h3>\n Ongoing Challenges\n</h3>\n<p>\n Despite these advances, challenges persist. Users are aware of the drift issues inherent in IMU-based systems, where the sensors may lose accuracy over time, necessitating recalibration (DMessage 1053). There are ongoing discussions on potential solutions like using SteamVR positional data to counteract drift and improve the stability of the sensor readings (DMessage 1054).\n</p>\n<p>\n In addition, some are considering how to refine their designs and prototypes to create more polished and less finicky devices. A user expresses the goal of developing a glove that can be used as a normal controller without needing to attach additional devices or deal with a complex setup (DMessage 1069). They emphasize that the goal is to avoid a project that requires external controllers or additional setup beyond the glove itself.\n</p>\n<h3>\n Project Milestones and Goals\n</h3>\n<p>\n There are clear milestones in these projects, such as having a functional prototype ready before graduation for a showcase (DMessage 1077). Some users also discuss sharing their work openly, with one user setting up a GitHub repository to share their code for the ApexGloves project (DMessage 1108).\n</p>\n<h3>\n Conclusion\n</h3>\n<p>\n The efforts being made to build a VR controller with integrated haptic feedback, motion tracking, and finger movement sensing are progressing, albeit with challenges in calibration, sensor accuracy, and feedback synchronization. The community continues to experiment with various approaches to create a functional and affordable alternative to existing commercial solutions.\n</p>\n",
    "analog_0": "<p>\n <strong>\n  Topic: Analog Systems in VR Development\n </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n This discussion explores various analog systems, focusing on VR controller input and movement tracking technologies, including the use of analog signals for controlling movement and enhancing user interaction in VR environments.\n</p>\n<h3>\n USB vs Bluetooth in VR Controllers\n</h3>\n<p>\n Participants discuss differences between USB and Bluetooth packet structures in the context of VR controllers. One user notes that USB packets are likely different from Bluetooth packets, which may affect how data is processed in a VR setup (DMessage 489). There is an interest in studying USB data directly due to the restrictive nature of APIs, with some choosing to bypass these APIs for more flexibility (DMessage 514).\n</p>\n<h3>\n WebXR and Controller Development\n</h3>\n<p>\n WebXR development is also discussed, with a user working on integrating VR controller axes data to move within a game using WebXR. This involves working through a gamepad API to access controller axes and implement user movement in a game (DMessage 516, DMessage 517). The lack of a universal VR USB standard is lamented, with some suggesting that such a standard would simplify VR development (DMessage 518).\n</p>\n<h3>\n Tracker Integration and Analog Input\n</h3>\n<p>\n In terms of integrating movement devices like VR treadmills, one user proposes using the tracker data as a simple analog controller input, where a treadmill\u2019s movement can be interpreted as walking input in a game, allowing the player to remain centered without triggering the playspace boundary. This setup would involve mapping the treadmill's directional data to analog stick input in VR games (DMessage 556). Another user suggests that virtual walking might be better represented through direct movement data instead of analog input, which could be inaccurate (DMessage 559).\n</p>\n<h3>\n Foot-Based Movement Systems\n</h3>\n<p>\n There is also discussion about potential foot-based analog input systems, such as pressure-sensitive mats or pads. These could allow users to simulate walking or running in place for VR games, potentially even incorporating skipping for fitness purposes. This idea aims to improve the immersion in VR by providing a more natural way to move without needing large spaces (DMessage 560, DMessage 561). One participant speculates that a pressure-sensitive mat with directional sensors could allow for turning while walking or running, offering a simple and effective solution for in-place movement (DMessage 560).\n</p>\n<h3>\n Practicality and Development\n</h3>\n<p>\n The practicality of implementing these analog systems in VR is considered, with one user pointing out the ease of implementing analog controls through existing systems, such as Xbox controllers, which are widely compatible with many software systems out of the box (DMessage 558). There is a recognition that while custom solutions may offer more immersion, existing tools and methods like analog inputs are often sufficient for current VR needs (DMessage 558).\n</p>\n<h3>\n Conclusion\n</h3>\n<p>\n Overall, the discussion highlights the potential and challenges of using analog inputs, such as USB data and pressure-sensitive mats, to enhance VR experiences. While some participants explore cutting-edge solutions, others focus on leveraging existing systems and technologies to simplify and improve VR gameplay.\n</p>\n",
    "analog_1": "<h3>\n Topic: Analog Inputs and VR Treadmills\n</h3>\n<h4>\n VR Locomotion Systems\n</h4>\n<p>\n The conversation dives into using analog inputs in virtual reality (VR) systems, particularly focused on locomotion devices such as VR treadmills. One person suggests integrating VR treadmills with OpenXR API standards so that various devices can communicate data regarding the player's speed and direction. This would allow the VR system to manage the player's movement in the game, without activating the playspace boundary (DMessage 554). The idea is to simulate the user walking around their play area with a virtual joystick input, simplifying the process of moving around in VR.\n</p>\n<p>\n Some users discuss alternative ways to control movement, particularly highlighting the challenge of mapping real-world walking to in-game motion. It's argued that while it may seem tempting to create a specific treadmill API, game developers already prefer using simple analog input, like a joystick or controller, which is compatible with most games out of the box (DMessage 558).\n</p>\n<h4>\n Pressure-Sensitive Mats and Foot Input\n</h4>\n<p>\n Another suggestion involves pressure-sensitive mats that track foot movements, enabling users to walk or run on the spot. Some envision a mat with sensors to allow turning in various directions while moving in VR. These ideas aim to make the experience more immersive, and there\u2019s a potential benefit in VR fitness, with suggestions of incorporating skipping into VR to enhance calorie burning (DMessage 560, DMessage 561).\n</p>\n<h4>\n Challenges with Analog Inputs\n</h4>\n<p>\n However, users acknowledge the limitations of mapping foot movement directly to analog inputs. They suggest a more efficient solution might be using a cumulative movement offset tracked by the system rather than relying on less precise analog mappings (DMessage 559). Despite these hurdles, the current system of analog input offers a balance between simplicity and functionality, making it a more practical solution for most VR games.\n</p>\n<h3>\n Custom Locomotion Systems and Controller Integration\n</h3>\n<p>\n In the quest for more tailored VR experiences, another user mentions building custom locomotion systems and controllers. This includes integrating rolling areas in the play space for added movement freedom, showing that innovation in VR control is expanding beyond traditional solutions (DMessage 618).\n</p>\n",
    "analog_2": "<h3>\n Topic: Mesh Morphing Robot &amp; Related Robotics Discussions\n</h3>\n<h4>\n Concept of Mesh Morphing Robot:\n</h4>\n<p>\n The idea of a \"Mesh Morphing Robot\" was introduced as a solution to create 3D shapes without relying on light, unlike traditional holographic methods that face limitations due to light behavior. The robot's core idea is a shape-shifting mechanism based on controlling the lengths of the edges and vertex angles of polygons, starting with a square. By altering edge lengths and adjusting angles between vertices, the polygon can transform into different shapes, such as rectangles and triangles. This basic polygonal robot can be combined with others to form more complex shapes, including humanoids, leveraging a simple yet effective mesh-based system.\n</p>\n<p>\n The robot can be built with relatively simple technologies, even components that were available as far back as the 1800s, such as motors or IPMCs (Ionic Polymer-Metal Composites) to adjust the polygons. The goal is to develop a 3D display alternative that does not rely on light projection systems but on physical shape transformation\u3010DMessage 1156\u3011.\n</p>\n<h4>\n Mesh Morphing Robotics Competition:\n</h4>\n<p>\n The creator of the mesh morphing robot is actively working on assembling a team of hardware developers and hosting a competition around this concept. The competition, starting in May, will have a grand prize of approximately $1000, with some resources provided to help competitors with the costs. The inventor invites collaboration and innovation in developing these robots, emphasizing a focus on design and building practical prototypes\u3010DMessage 1158\u3011.\n</p>\n<h4>\n Robotics Design Challenges &amp; Solutions:\n</h4>\n<p>\n One of the technical challenges discussed relates to sourcing the necessary components for building the robots. Specifically, a component (Triad Semi TS4231) needed for the design is hard to obtain, requiring a friend to do the surface-mount soldering. This highlights the difficulties faced in obtaining precise components for complex designs, especially when dealing with tiny packages like a 1.6mm BGA (Ball Grid Array) footprint\u3010DMessage 1171-1173\u3011.\n</p>\n<p>\n Moreover, the design process includes addressing issues like spacing for components, particularly when using services like JLCPCB. The minimum distance between pads for the TS4231 footprint was adjusted to meet the service's requirements. The designer also considered using 4-layer boards to better manage routing and signal integrity, though the higher cost might be overkill for simpler applications\u3010DMessage 1190-1195\u3011.\n</p>\n<h4>\n Critique of Universities in Robotics Development:\n</h4>\n<p>\n The inventor also expressed frustration with academic institutions, arguing that universities are not ideal places for innovative work in robotics. He criticized their rigid academic structures and outdated teaching methods, which he believes stifle creativity and innovation. His experience with universities and researchers at prestigious institutions like Stanford and MIT led him to conclude that the current academic system is more focused on traditional research and career outcomes than on fostering true innovation in fields like robotics. This contrasts with his own work, where he has managed to build advanced robots outside of these institutions\u3010DMessage 1160-1162\u3011.\n</p>\n"
