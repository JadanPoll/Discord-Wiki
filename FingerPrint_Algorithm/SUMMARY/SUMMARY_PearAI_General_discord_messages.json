Others, like\n   <strong>\n    one user\n   </strong>\n   , mentioned being in\n   <strong>\n    Calc 3\n   </strong>\n   , which they found to be more challenging than\n   <strong>\n    Linear Algebra\n   </strong>\n   , despite only being a month into the course. One user expressed that they\n   <strong>\n    found Calc 2\n   </strong>\n   concepts harder compared to\n   <strong>\n    Calc 3\n   </strong>\n   , which they attributed to the\n   <strong>\n    teacher\u2019s teaching style\n   </strong>\n   . In contrast, another user noted that their understanding of\n   <strong>\n    Calc 3\n   </strong>\n   might improve when they retake it in university.\n  </p>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p>\n   A user also shared that\n   <strong>\n    Calc 1\n   </strong>\n   wasn't that difficult and recommended using\n   <strong>\n    YouTube tutorials\n   </strong>\n   for better explanations, as they found them more helpful than professors' methods. The general consensus was that\n   <strong>\n    calculus\n   </strong>\n   tends to get progressively harder, especially after\n   <strong>\n    Calc 1\n   </strong>\n   . However, some students felt they could handle the increasing difficulty, with one person\n   <strong>\n    joking\n   </strong>\n   that\n   <strong>\n    PearAI\n   </strong>\n   work was harder than\n   <strong>\n    calculus\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n <strong>\n  Work and Streaming\n </strong>\n</h4>\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <strong>\n   Streaming\n  </strong>\n  was a topic of interest, with users asking if\n  <strong>\n   JME\n  </strong>\n  was streaming on a particular day.

They expressed frustration, feeling like it might be a setback. Another student, however, shared that\n   <strong>\n    Calc 1\n   </strong>\n   wasn't as hard as expected and recommended\n   <strong>\n    YouTube tutorials\n   </strong>\n   for better understanding, as they found them more helpful than some professors at university.\n  </p>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p>\n   The general consensus was that\n   <strong>\n    calculus\n   </strong>\n   would become progressively harder, with one student mentioning they were currently in\n   <strong>\n    Calc 3\n   </strong>\n   , which they found more challenging than\n   <strong>\n    Linear Algebra\n   </strong>\n   . Despite only being a month into the course, they were already struggling, but hoped their\n   <strong>\n    college applications\n   </strong>\n   would be finished soon, which would relieve some stress. Another student reflected on the\n   <strong>\n    Calc 3\n   </strong>\n   experience, noting that the difficulty often depends on the\n   <strong>\n    professor's teaching style\n   </strong>\n   . They had encountered both difficult and easy-to-follow teaching methods for\n   <strong>\n    Calc 3\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p>\n   One user pointed out that taking\n   <strong>\n    Calc 3\n   </strong>\n   early could be advantageous, as they might retake it in university and better understand the concepts after gaining more experience.\n  </p>\n </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n <strong>\n  College Experience and Streaming\n </strong>\n</h4>\n<ul>\n <li>\n  The conversation shifted to\n  <strong>\n   college life\n  </strong>\n  , with one person commenting that the\n  <strong>\n   only thing they had learned\n  </strong>\n  from college so far was\n  <strong>\n   marketing\n  </strong>\n  . This sentiment suggested that practical experience often offered more value than some formal education, especially in certain fields. Another user inquired if\n  <strong>\n   JME\u2019s streaming schedule\n  </strong>\n  would change after quitting a job, showing interest in how\n  <strong>\n   personal commitments\n  </strong>\n  affect professional activities.\n </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n <strong>\n  Open-Source Engagement\n </strong>\n</h4>\n<ul>\n <li>\n  A new community member introduced themselves, expressing excitement about contributing to\n  <strong>\n   open-source projects\n  </strong>\n  for the first time.

One person mentioned they had just started\n   <strong>\n    Calc 1\n   </strong>\n   and were working on\n   <strong>\n    limits\n   </strong>\n   . Another user noted that\n   <strong>\n    Calc 1\n   </strong>\n   was easier compared to other challenging tasks, like the work involved in\n   <strong>\n    PearAI\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    Math Difficulty\n   </strong>\n   : The difficulty level of math increased as the conversation shifted to more advanced topics like\n   <strong>\n    discrete math\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    Calc 3\n   </strong>\n   . One user mentioned that\n   <strong>\n    discrete math\n   </strong>\n   was particularly tough for them, primarily due to their\n   <strong>\n    professor\u2019s teaching style\n   </strong>\n   . They also explained that\n   <strong>\n    discrete math\n   </strong>\n   felt like counting on a number line, which contrasted with\n   <strong>\n    partial differential equations (PDEs)\n   </strong>\n   . Another user described\n   <strong>\n    Calc 3\n   </strong>\n   as being harder than\n   <strong>\n    Linear Algebra\n   </strong>\n   , even though they had only been in class for a month. Despite the struggle, they expressed optimism about finishing their\n   <strong>\n    college applications\n   </strong>\n   , which would alleviate some stress.\n  </p>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    Teaching Influence\n   </strong>\n   : The challenge of math often depends on the\n   <strong>\n    professor\n   </strong>\n   , with one user recalling that their\n   <strong>\n    Calc 3\n   </strong>\n   teacher made the material easy to follow, while their first Calc 3 teacher had made it nearly impossible. This highlighted the significant role teaching style plays in understanding difficult concepts. Another student mentioned that they planned to retake\n   <strong>\n    Calc 3\n   </strong>\n   once in university, feeling that a second attempt might make the content easier to grasp.\n  </p>\n </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n <strong>\n  Open-Source Contribution\n </strong>\n</h4>\n<ul>\n <li>\n  A new community member introduced themselves, expressing excitement about joining the group and contributing to\n  <strong>\n   open-source projects\n  </strong>\n  for the first time.
