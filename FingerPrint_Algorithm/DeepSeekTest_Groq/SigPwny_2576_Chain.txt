yeah we teach yâ€™all to pick locks if youâ€™re interested in stuff like that wanna help make badges for next fallctf? (Message ID: 2543).
I'm so down I don't wanna toot my own horn but I'm kinda goated at lock picking I have a nice set I built and I'm a blue belt on the subreddit so if y'all need lock help I can totally do it I could honestly do a full breakdown and reassembly of a padlock if that interests people (Message ID: 2544).
wanna help pick a safe we have a safe we want to pick lmfao (Message ID: 2547).
What brand safe Do you have any pics of it? (Message ID: 2548).
weâ€™ll bring to our lock pick meeting fs (Message ID: 2551).
Bet bet bet When are yall thinking about the lockpick meeting I'd love to get involved (Message ID: 2552).
Bet I'm kicking my feet and giggling with excitement (Message ID: 2554).
where'd you buy equipment/practice locks? i wanna get better at lockpicking, but i don't want to spend a lot of money, and every time i've tried it at sigpwny events i've been bad at it so i'll probably have to start with a clear lock and work up from there (Message ID: 2555).
Guys, let's be honest, there's only one lockpick you'll really ever need  Gun (Message ID: 2556).
Sentrysafe Dial safe I already picked the tubular lock (Message ID: 2557).
Picks: I'd recommend https://www.sparrowslockpicks.com/ or https://www.southord.com/. Don't spend more than 30 dollars on pick kits, especially cause all you actually need to get started is a turning tool and a single pick.

For locks, all you really need is a master 3 and a master 140 to learn the basics of locks, and those aren't more than 8ish each (Message ID: 2558).
most expensive lockpick (Message ID: 2560).
Ofc, feel free to (Message ID: 2568).
I started with LPL genesis and bought singles from southord after, buying tools individually is so much better than packs (Message ID: 2573).
Fair, I think for me I just needed a place to start lol Like start with something small then buy what you need (Message ID: 2574).
But for your first thing def buying a kit is the moves 100% just for a place to start (Message ID: 2575).
If I had to do over I might have just gotten a few hooks and TOK tho I only know that because now I know my personal preferences tho lol (Message ID: 2576).
we just upgraded all our picks to sparrows ones :D (Message ID: 2577).
Sparrows is awesome but for cheap individual picks I loooooove southord (Message ID: 2578).
Thatâ€™s fair, southord is also really good Wait unrelated so how is the Covert Instruments stuff? LPL be annoying me with the shameless plugs they better be worth it lol (Message ID: 2579).
To be completely fair, the tools feel very quality. However, I think they're quite pricy for what they are The genesis came with 2 picks and 2 wave rakes, plus turners. They're the highest quality tools I own, but if the pick is a 10/10 tool, the $2 southord pick is an 8/10 tool (Message ID: 2580).
I see, yeah fair Wait lol the kick start does nearly the same picks for like $8 cheaper Thats wild (Message ID: 2581).
I like the disc detainer pick It feels great I don't think I would purchase normal picks from CI Other than those fancy tool that I don't remember the name of but ngl it sounded Japanese The Lishi tools Those things like auto pick locks lol (Message ID: 2582).
So CI is more specialty stuff They do have a shockingly high selection of just straight up bypass tools Not really my scene tbh I feel like unless Iâ€™m legit planning on committing a crime very few of them are necessary to own lol (Message ID: 2583).
oh W what makes quality in a lockpick? where do you feel the difference? i'm guessing dimensions play a role, the thinner/smaller profile the better, and then maybe the strength or "springiness" of the metal also? bypass tools are INTERESTING (Message ID: 2584).
No yeah theyâ€™re definitely interesting, I just prefer to lead people more towards the locksport scene since bypass tools arenâ€™t hard to use and convey criminal intent in a number of jurisdictions Lockpicking is more of a puzzle to me You wanna be able to feel whatâ€™s happening in the lock as much as possible, essentially Tbh a lot of ppl have strong preferences there but springiness generally makes it tough to feel a response Thickness/thinness all depends on the keyway youâ€™re trying to get inside, imo go as thick as you can while still being able to move in the keyway comfortably, makes it easier to maneuver pins Another thing about quality: how the picks do under pressure You donâ€™t wanna have to keep buying picks every time you remotely put pressure on them Covered handles are also nice but more expensive, for the lockpicking meeting Iâ€™m just making yâ€™all cope Maybe Iâ€™ll cover them in identifiable tape, two birds with one stone! (Message ID: 2585).
could be huge honestly could be huge for my own collection too me adding washi tape to the budget (Message ID: 2587).
wait a bulk washi tape buy would go crazy i need washi tape (Message ID: 2588).
sigpwny washi tape (Message ID: 2589).
Tbh I feel like CI just jacks prices and uses LPL and McNally to shill for them to sell to noobs All the guys on the lockpicking forums hate CI (Message ID: 2590).
ok that was kind of my instinct lol but i didnt wanna say it because i dont actually own any of their picks (Message ID: 2591).
I'll bring my picks to next meeting. CI stuff is definitely quality but like severly overpriced to lure in inexperienced pickers I have 0 problem using my cheap picks compared to my CI picks (Message ID: 2592).
They seem like just fine picks itâ€™s just like the one people hear about from influencers so you kinda pay for the name probably (Message ID: 2593).
I mean to be completely honest, there's not much variation you can get from pick designs. A short hook is a short hook from no matter who you buy from The handles on the CI stuff is nice but handles are completely optional Half my tools don't have handles and I still use them as much if not more than the CI stuff (Message ID: 2594).
then we could actually give everyone sets of picks (Message ID: 2601).
cuz I'm not gonna lie even as someone pretty into locksport I still get devious thoughts sometimes (Message ID: 2607).
what are illinois rules for picks (Message ID: 2608).
but good as a means of getting people's hands on tools (Message ID: 2612).
Picks are cheap I feel like the barrier for entry is shipping time and locks (Message ID: 2615).
I am not against it in the sense that most unlawful entry crimes donâ€™t involve lockpicks. I am in the sense that if someone tried something stupid a business card would be traced right back to us (Message ID: 2616).
Imagine they leave picks at the crime scene and the sigpwny logo is stamped on it ðŸ˜­ (Message ID: 2617).
I can tell people that unlawful lockpicking is not only wrong but inefficient but that unfortunately doesnâ€™t mean theyâ€™ll believe me :( (Message ID: 2618).
