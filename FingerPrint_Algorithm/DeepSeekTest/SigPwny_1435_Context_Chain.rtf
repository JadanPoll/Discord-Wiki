\f0\fs24 \cf0 ~~slide 26 has code~~ Fun fact: The hardest <500 level class (in terms of prereqs) at uiuc is `SE 495`:\
https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2023/fall/SE/495\
\
Requiring you to take (at minimum) --\
\
MATH 221, PHYS 211, TAM 211, MATH 415, CS 101, TAM 251, MATH 231, SE 495, SE 311, SE 261, IE 310, MATH 241, SE 312, TAM 212, SE 310, IE 300, TAM 335, SE 494 (Message ID: 1354).  Probably satisfied just by reading and comprehending the long list of prereqs (Message ID: 1357). Hardest CS class:\
\
CS 439\
Prereqs: MATH 221, MATH 231, MATH 463, MATH 213, MATH 112, CS 124, CS 128, CS 225, ECE 391, CS 439, CS 341, CS 233 (Message ID: 1358). Wait, I just realized, aren't those prereqs just chains? Like, 341 requires 233 and 225? Or at least some of them (Message ID: 1359). yeah, i meant coming into the college (Message ID: 1360). Ah Imagine coming in as a freshman and being able to take 439 (Message ID: 1361). damn never mind you gotta take both 341 and 391 \uc0\u55357 \u56448  https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2023/fall/ECE/439 (Message ID: 1362). wait huh you can take cs 439, which is equivalent, without 391 sussy (Message ID: 1364). hmm yeah true on 439 sheet I saw somewhere, recommend pre-req was 438, and required was 341 (Message ID: 1366). does 391 cover networking in depth? Probably default "systems" requirement for ECE and then they threw in 341 bc you need networking can't take it \u55357 \u56877  (Message ID: 1368). ECE 391? no (Message ID: 1371). at least not when I took it https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/ECE391/sp2023/ yeah I don't see anything networking here (Message ID: 1373). To be fair, 341 didn't *really* cover networking. I mean, we covered some of the syscalls and how to use them, but we didn't really get into how they work under the hood But apparently 341 is only user-space or whatever Smadge (Message ID: 1374). yeah like what I feel about 341 vs 391 is like, in 341 you build upon the syscall API. in 391 you build the syscall API (Message ID: 1375). If I knew that, I would've honestly taken 391 (Message ID: 1376). But it's fine, I assume 423 does 391's job but more? Or, I mean it covers that material, just more in-depth (Message ID: 1378). CS 423? not really. they are very different in terms of what you do 391 makes you build your own kernel. 423 makes you extend upon the Linux kernel the material has overlaps, but the MPs feels completely different like think about it this way think about building an OS from the ground up and having to consult device manuals to make things work vs figuring out the Linux in-kernel APIs to do stuffs, figuring out how Linux's memory management / scheduler works and call the right functions I'm not saying the latter is easier, but in terms of understanding how OS kernels work, 391 is way more effective tbh, I think 341 & 423 material are probably more applicable in the real world like nobody wants you to write an OS from the ground up you're more likely gonna write drivers if you are doing kernel stuffs, or write backend software if userspace (Message ID: 1379). According to Noelle it used to cover networking but at least this semester it didn\'92t. I plan to take 438 to get some supplementary knowledge there but I got an alright introduction in 461 Would you recommend 423 if I liked learning about OS and wanted to take another class in it? Tbf I don\'92t think the goal of building a kernel from the ground up is that you\'92re gonna have to do it later, I think it teaches you the ins and outs of computers/systems while also giving you the practical skills to work with large codebases and organize a team, which in both research and industry is extremely valuable and the CS curriculum fails to supplement with CS 222 If the CS department finds a worthy equivalent (they got close with the 128 and 225 final project and then scrapped both of them, not sure if 222 projects are better this semester though) I\'92d give similar praise (Message ID: 1383). hmm yeah It's an interesting class so why not (Message ID: 1384). ive heard the overlap with 391 is really big so im hesitant otherwise i would just go for it tbh also is it a group proj class, as much as i've liked 391 i think group projects make it easy for me to fall into the trap of basically pm-ing, which im fine with in any other context but when im trying to learn it can be distracting (Message ID: 1385). Pros: you get to be in a class with <@390288271781003266>\
Cons: you get to be in a class with me (Message ID: 1386). Fair, but if you're interested in OS, I'd still go for it. After all, it's not like the overlap will be 100%. I only wouldn't if you really wanted another class or set of classes (Message ID: 1388). next semester? planning to do 374, 438, 440, and a gen ed or fun class (Message ID: 1391). 374 is hard but the best core CS course (my opinion my change depending on my final course grade though, lmao) 438...<@506774854796705841>? Heard it's not too bad 440 just seems annoying tbh But I have no idea honestly (Message ID: 1392). this semester was ece 391, cs 461, cs 210, and a gen ed...i like what im learning but im definitely overwhelmed (Message ID: 1393). That's honestly a fine schedule, but I do think adding 423 would push you over the threshold of "light schedule" (Message ID: 1394). 440 im taking because i want to be at least conversational in ai and i have friends taking it next semster (Message ID: 1395). Dude, this was me last semester with 341, 433, gen ed, and 211 And guess which one was the hardest by far? The stupid gen ed (Message ID: 1396). AAS 100 was such a bad class (Message ID: 1398). omg i dropped AAS 100 last semester lol after the first week i was like "no" (Message ID: 1399). Yeah...I should've heeded the warnings Dude, the first week was the best week, because the class started pandering way more in the later periods The readings were just 50-100 pages of trite, repetitive world salad that repeated the same core ideas 85 times, only slightly differently each time so eventually, you'd be left with a new idea at the end, but a barely new idea at that And then it didn't even matter, because on the tests, all you had to do is cite one sentence from the text and say "hegemony" a bunch of times, and you'd ace them (Message ID: 1402). yea tbh i dropped when i realized i had to print and annotate every reading lol (Message ID: 1403). Oh god, that's way worse lmao. We didn't And the class was still tedious (Message ID: 1406). it seemed like too much work and the teacher wouldnt let me use my laptop to take notes and like i just didnt wanna carry around a notebook for a single class? (Message ID: 1407). I also low-key wish I took 391 instead of 341, because even though 341 was a GPA boost and a very fun and easy class for me, I do wish it dove more in-depth into kernel architecture It honestly might've paired well with 433 Or at least, it would've paired better, especially some of the memory units Goddang (Message ID: 1408). Our teacher just straight up forbade laptops in class ~~Didn't stop me, though~~ (Message ID: 1410). I wish I could take every class at once \uc0\u55357 \u56854  (Message ID: 1425). Would be better if a. I took 4 CH instead of 3 CH (but I also would be dying more than I am now, so I guess it's not all bad), and b. took it when I also wasn't taking 374 lmao (Message ID: 1435). im kinda worried abt 391 next sem but i think i found myself a decent group I heard this class is a lot of work but at least more palatable w a group? (Message ID: 1438). ok touche next sem for me looks pretty nice (Message ID: 1440). ece 391, ece 408, cs 440, music gened HPC gang \u55357 \u56490  (Message ID: 1442). ECE 408 is...it's alright (Message ID: 1443). No, it's just a cross-registration I do like CUDA and GPU programming, but debugging GPUs when you don't have the GPU is a bit annoying (Message ID: 1447). ece 479 (IoT and cog computing for ece) is having us do gpu work w/o a gpu im having a bad time in that class <a:disintergrate:1067602738449494127> i see (Message ID: 1450). Which you can do for most tasks because they give you the libs, but I don't think they explicitly give you the headers for ECE 408 Of course, I think you could literally just rewrite the relevant parts of the headers and then link the lib based on the build files (or just build it from scratch, ig), but I haven't done that I will say, ECE 408 is probably the single-most "stressful until it isn't" class Just because you'll have no idea why something isn't working and be stuck on it for 2 hours, and then it'll just be a bunch of silly errors and you go on your merry way Again, mitigated by good debugging principles, but for the final project, lmao Also, the tests are hard (Message ID: 1451). wait what is the final project? does it vary per sem? (Message ID: 1452). You just write a convolutional kernel for deep learning The final stretch is actually very cool (Message ID: 1453). holy shit im doing that in ece 479 rn LMAO (Message ID: 1456). I mean, there isn't much beyond that, because GPU work is either shader code or DL kernels Usually It's either rendering or GPGPU The optimization step sets it apart, though It is quite cool, and I do wish they spent more time on them instead of just "here's a bunch, pick and choose" Namely with things like FFTConv, Winograd, and Tensor Cores. Also, separable convs. Oddly enough, neither Winograd nor separable convs are there (probably because separable conv requires, well, separability, which isn't guaranteed, but is quite common) And Winograd, is, well, Winograd But they do have matrix unrolling -> conv as matmul, so idrk But yeah, that's been my experience with 408 so far, not looking forward to the final, though... (Message ID: 1457). Thanks Why is everybody taking 440, though, lmao? Okay, looking at the curriculum, this actually seems quite good Some very interesting things in here... (Message ID: 1459). one q i have tho what is the diff between 440 and 441 i heard from a few ppl 440 was better in the fall so im taking that (Message ID: 1460). <@391035254619635713> You've taken 441, right? (Message ID: 1461). i dont like it but if you take it in the fall <@297854667310891009> the professor is much better Roy Choudhury "i dont like it" is an understatement haha but i think the content is very cool so I dont want to leave a too negative impression on you the correct impression is ||i hate it|| (Message ID: 1462). class is a mess, professor is a very meh lecturer and exam is just rote memorizing mp is also very easy and not even networking-y (Message ID: 1464). but AG is bad and doc is bad so it gets confusing (Message ID: 1466). fellow bangla professor??? (Message ID: 1467). (Roy is the good prof) (Message ID: 1468). tbh that was sort of the appeal to me, easy workload with a good teacher (Roy) (Message ID: 1469). (current Prof who I hate is Deepak) (tho he gives good grade so whatever) (Message ID: 1470). i meant easy in a sense that you dont learn much (Message ID: 1473). i dont think i have learned a single thing from those mps (Message ID: 1475). i didnt take 341' so i imagine the content will at least teach me a little (Message ID: 1476). where as in other classes i learned most if not all of the content through mp 425 4CH for example (Message ID: 1477). 425 4ch is seductively appealing to me but im gonna save it for fall senior year if i take it at all (Message ID: 1478). especially if i find a place online to do physics then i have no reason to not do 425 fall senior year i think i want very little work when doing 374 tho like i want time to take in the information (Message ID: 1480). 374 + 425 was not the move with my schedule, I feel like my 425 experience has suffered as a result (Message ID: 1481). yea i feel like taking hard classes together was not the move i thought it would be (Message ID: 1482). But I\'92ll be real, if I had dialed it back in some of the other classes, and just focusing on those two Actually would\'92ve been decent Good thing I learned my lesson and am now taking 423 and 426 Along with 461 and 476 (Message ID: 1483). Unironically that\'92d be hype (Message ID: 1487). yifei i\'92d take your class (Message ID: 1489). yifei the class would be soooo hype (Message ID: 1490). you can probably go take ravi's class at MIT (Message ID: 1493). Well, I\'92ll have to first get into MIT lmao (Message ID: 1494). if ravi records his class i'll watch it lol (Message ID: 1495). just pretend you're in the class and go to the lectures you can do the MPs anyways since they are public <:steelheh:870747043554005052> (Message ID: 1496). fair enough lol while i have u captive here yifei i really like os stuff but im kinda bad at it. other than banging your head against a wall and osdev are there good resources for getting better? (Message ID: 1497). uhhh I didn't mean like 'rtfm'. I meant like, just randomly browsing the man pages and you learn something new every day (Message ID: 1507). The osdev wiki is also very approachable (Message ID: 1509). oh I see lol, tbf "rtdc/rtfm" is not like, bad advice, i think i like the end result of knowing hard things but sometimes have trouble pushing myself to actually just learn them. that being said, i could probably just replace my tvtropes/wikipedia addiction with man pages and learn a lot so this is good advice to me lol (Message ID: 1510). wikipedia addiction <:surprisedfry:586141576535736325> (Message ID: 1511). it's so bad i have read the plots of so many movies i have not seen (Message ID: 1512). <:surprisedfry:586141576535736325> (Message ID: 1513).}
