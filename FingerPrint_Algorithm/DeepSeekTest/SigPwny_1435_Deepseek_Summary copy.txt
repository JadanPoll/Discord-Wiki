\f0\fs24 \cf0 ### **Hardest Courses at UIUC by Prereqs**  \\n- **SE 495**: Cited as the hardest sub-500 level class due to its extensive prereqs (MATH 221, PHYS 211, TAM 211, etc.), effectively requiring completion of many core courses beforehand (Message 1354, 1357).  \\n- **CS 439**: Noted as a challenging CS course with layered prerequisites (MATH/CS chains including CS 341 and ECE 391). Taking CS 439 as a freshman is deemed near-impossible due to the cumulative requirements (Messages 1358, 1360-1362).  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Systems & OS Course Comparisons**  \\n1. **CS 341 vs. ECE 391**:  \\n   - **CS 341** focuses on **user-space systems programming** (e.g., syscall usage) but lacks depth in kernel architecture (Messages 1374-1375).  \\n   - **ECE 391** involves **building a kernel from scratch**, requiring low-level hardware interaction and offering a deeper systems understanding (Message 1379).  \\n   - Overlap with **CS 423** (Linux kernel extensions) exists, but 391\'92s foundational focus is praised for teaching team collaboration and large codebase navigation (Message 1379, 1383).  \\n\\n2. **ECE 391 Workload**:  \\n   - Group projects are critical but can lead to management distractions (Message 1385).  \\n   - Students recommend pairing it with lighter courses (Message 1394).  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Other Course Discussions**  \\n1. **CS 440 (AI)**:  \\n   - Viewed as essential for basic AI literacy, despite mixed reviews on utility. Fall semester with Prof. Roy Choudhury is preferred (Message 1460, 1469).  \\n   - Contrasted with **CS 441** (networking), criticized for rote memorization and poor lecture quality (Messages 1464, 1473).  \\n\\n2. **CS 374 (Algorithms)**:  \\n   - Universally acknowledged as rigorous but highly recommended for core CS competency (Message 1392).  \\n\\n3. **ECE 408 (GPU Programming)**:  \\n   - Praised for hands-on CUDA/convolution work but criticized for debugging challenges without physical GPU access (Messages 1451-1457).  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Gen Ed & Workload Experiences**  \\n- **AAS 100** was universally panned for excessive readings, annotation requirements, and vague assessments (Messages 1398-1403).  \\n- **Balancing Workloads**: Students caution against stacking heavy courses like 374 + 425, advocating for strategic scheduling (Messages 1480-1483).  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### **OS/Kernel Learning Resources**  \\n- **Practical Advice**:  \\n  - Consult **man pages** and **osdev.org** for foundational OS concepts (Messages 1507, 1509).  \\n  - Self-directed exploration (e.g., MIT\'92s public course materials) is encouraged for deeper learning (Message 1496).  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Miscellaneous**  \\n- **Course Planning**: Students debate tradeoffs between GPA-friendly classes (e.g., CS 341) vs. intellectually rewarding but grueling courses (e.g., ECE 391) (Message 1408).  \\n- **Group Projects**: Mixed feelings about their educational value in classes like ECE 391 (Message 1385).  \\n\\n*Key Themes*: Prerequisite complexity (Messages 1354-1362), systems course depth (1374-1379), and workload tradeoffs dominate the discourse.}
