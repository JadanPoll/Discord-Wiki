Like looking at the table of content of a book to find something interesting
One way, for each token in the text, check if there's entry of that token within database, if yes, add that index to existing word, otherwise add new entry to it


That way we can look up web stem and instantly get pages on it all at once
There are approximately 1 million words in the english language


words in the english language that are actively used:170,000 to 200,000


stemmed words is about 20,000 to 30,000


The upper limit on my index size is much, much smaller. There are about 170,000 words in English, and about 6,500 languages in the world. That gives us an estimate of the size of the index: And each entry is just a word, average length around 10 bytes. So about 11 Gigabytes of data. And of course, we can store that in an easily searchable order – for example, alphabetically, so we can find records we want quickl

When

Google search engine: Output informaiton based not only on whats directly related to your search query but whats likely to be helpful/reliable in a given context
[

Lol google does hundreds of thousands of search quality tests! Every year! to make sure their bar for quality is high
[

A challenge google might face is data voids

Where high quality information might just not be readily available

Possibly because google was made and created by researchers so that's the company culture

I wonder, how much of google is autonomous, or what's the word, unsupervised learning and how much is carefully picked out parameters for stuff

Google’s Knowledge Graph isn’t just rooted in public sources such as Freebase, Wikipedia and the CIA World Factbook

The Knowledge Graph also helps us understand the relationships between things. Marie Curie is a person in the Knowledge Graph, and she had two children, one of whom also won a Nobel Prize, as well as a husband, Pierre Curie, who claimed a third Nobel Prize for the family. All of these are linked in our graph. It’s not just a catalog of objects; it also models all these inter-relationships. It’s the intelligence between these different entities that’s the key.

We’ve always believed that the perfect search engine should understand exactly what you mean and give you back exactly what you want. And we can now sometimes help answer your next question before you’ve asked it, because the facts we show are informed by what other people have searched for. For example, the information we show for Tom Cruise answers 37 percent of next queries that people ask about him. In fact, some of the most serendipitous discoveries I’ve made using the Knowledge Graph are through the magical “People also search for” feature
